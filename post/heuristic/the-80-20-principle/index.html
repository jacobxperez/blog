                <h2>Introduction</h2>

                <p>The majority of the effects come from the minority of the causes on average an 80 to 20 percent
                    ratio. To optimize performance identify the top 20 percent and decrease or remove the remaining 80
                    percent. If no benefit comes from prioritizing, then the priorities need to be reevaluated. Any
                    improvement that goes beyond the 20 percent will only cause inefficient results. </p>

                    <h2>How Steve Jobs saved Apple</h2>

                    <p>In 1996 Apple was on the verge of bankruptcy, the then CEO Gil Amelio in
                        an attempt to save Apple from imminent collapse, purchased a company
                        by the name of NeXT, a startup computer company started by Steve Jobs
                        after his discharge from Apple. Gil Amelio needed to turn Apple back
                        on track and NeXT had just what he needed, a state of the art
                        operating system, and Steve.</p>

                    <p>
                        As part of the deal, Steve would return to Apple as Gil Amelio's advisor. Under Steve, Apple
                        went
                        through a series of priority change. Steve immediately reduced the product line to four products
                        focusing on quality rather than quantity and laid-off up to 3,000 employees. The following
                        fiscal
                        year of 1997 Apple earned $309 million in profit and Steve Jobs who was fired from Apple in 1985
                        returned to his rightful position as the new CEO.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Steve Jobs's brutal approach of simplifying and eliminating what is not necessary saved Apple
                        from
                        bankruptcy. In 2011 Apple became the world's most valuable company.

                    <h2>Identify the 20 percent</h2>

                    <p>The following strategy will help you identify the 20 percent.</p>

                    <h3>Set Clear Goals</h3>

                    <p>
                        Write down exactly what you want to accomplish and be as specific as possible. Having a clear
                        definite goal will help you formulate a plan to achieve it. Written goals have a higher chance
                        of
                        being completed.</p>

                    <h3>Make a List</h3>

                    <p>Once a clear goal has been selected you can begin to make a list of all the things that need to
                        be
                        done to accomplish it. Organize the list by priorities or by sequence to determine what needs to
                        be
                        done first.</p>

                    <h3>Simplify the List</h3>

                    <p>After priorities have been identified you can now remove unimportant items from the list. To
                        simplify, cross-off things that are not important, then delay tasks that do not need to be done
                        today. By removing as much as possible from the list you will be able to focus on the 20
                        percent.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Stay Focus</h3>

                    <p>Multitasking will only make you less productive and more prone to errors. Limit yourself to work
                        on
                        one task at a time and do not start on any other items before finishing up the top three
                        priorities
                        on the list. Eliminate distractions from your work area and turn off all notifications from your
                        phone.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

                    <p>The 80/20 principle is not a strict rule to live by since critical variables may vary between 10
                        to
                        30 percent depending on the complexity of the project. Improvements that go beyond the 20
                        percent
                        will only cause inefficient results. Therefore, it is often best to settle for a satisfying
                        solution
                        rather than searching for an optimal one.</p>
