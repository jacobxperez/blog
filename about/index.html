I took business, programming, art, and design courses during my formal academic journey. I can combine programming logic skills with design thinking methods to find and develop innovative business solutions. </p> <h3>What can I do for you?</h3> <p> I can work with team members by committing to Git or designing together in Figma. As a designer, I can sketch wireframes and prototype user experience designs using Adobe XD, Photoshop, Illustrator, and Figma. As a developer, I code responsive websites in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Over time I have developed RAMs, a web framework that allows me to quickly assemble any design with minimal effort and very few lines of code. Also, I am a photographer, and I take immense pleasure in taking pictures of people and landscapes.</p> </article> </template> </body></html>
