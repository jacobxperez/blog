                The majority of the effects come from the minority of the causes on average an 80 to 20 percent ratio. To optimize
                performance identify the top 20 percent and decrease or remove the remaining 80 percent. If no benefit comes from
                prioritizing, then the priorities need to be reevaluated. Any improvement beyond the 20 percent will only cause inefficient
                results.

                <p>
                    The 80/20 principle also called the “Pareto Principle” is observed in areas of business, economics, management,
                    manufacturing, and software development.

                <p>
                    In 1996 Apple was on the verge of bankruptcy, the then CEO Gil Amelio in an attempt to save Apple from imminent
                    collapse, purchased a company by the name of NeXT, a startup computer company started by Steve Jobs after his discharge
                    from Apple. Gil Amelio needed to turn Apple back on track and NeXT had just what he needed, a state of the art operating
                    system, and Steve.
                </p>

                <p>
                    As part of the deal, Steve would return to Apple as Gil Amelio's advisor. Under Steve, Apple went through a series of
                    priority change. Steve immediately reduced the product line to four products focusing on quality rather than quantity
                    and laid-off up to 3,000 employees. The following fiscal year of 1997 Apple earned $309 million in profit and Steve Jobs
                    who was fired from Apple in 1985 returned to his rightful position as the new CEO.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Steve Jobs's brutal approach of simplifying and eliminating what is not necessary saved Apple from bankruptcy. In 2011
                    Apple became the world's most valuable company.

                <h2 id="identify">Identify the 20 percent</h2>

                <p>The following strategy will help you identify the 20 percent.</p>

                <h3 id="goals">Set Clear Goals</h3>

                <p>
                    Write down exactly what you want to accomplish and be as specific as possible. Having a clear definite goal will help
                    you formulate a plan to achieve it. Written goals have a higher chance of being completed.
                </p>

                <h3 id="make-list">Make a List</h3>

                <p>
                    Once a clear goal has been selected you can begin to make a list of all the things that need to be done to accomplish
                    it. Organize the list by priorities or by sequence to determine what needs to be done first.
                </p>

                <h3 id="simplify">Simplify the List</h3>

                <p>
                    After priorities have been identified you can now remove unimportant items from the list. To simplify, cross-off things
                    that are not important, then delay tasks that do not need to be done today. By removing as much as possible from the
                    list you will be able to focus on the 20 percent.
                </p>

                <h3 id="focus">Stay Focus</h3>

                <p>
                    Multitasking will only make you less productive and more prone to errors. Limit yourself to work on one task at a time
                    and do not start on any other items before finishing up the top three priorities on the list. Eliminate distractions
                    from your work area and turn off all notifications from your phone.
                </p>

                <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

                <p>
                    The 80/20 principle is not a strict rule to live by since critical variables may vary between 10 to 30 percent depending
                    on the complexity of the project. Improvements that go beyond the 20 percent will only cause inefficient results.
                    Therefore, it is often best to settle for a satisfying solution rather than searching for an optimal one.
